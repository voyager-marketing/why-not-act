# Writing Style Guidelines

This project targets the general American public across all political perspectives. Content must be accessible, warm, and human.

## Punctuation

- **No em dashes (—)** - Use commas, periods, or rewrite the sentence instead
- **No en dashes (–)** in prose - Hyphens (-) are fine for compound words
- Avoid semicolons in user-facing copy - Split into two sentences

## Sentence Structure

- Write like you're talking to a neighbor, not drafting a legal document
- Short sentences. Mix in some longer ones for flow, but keep it conversational.
- Start sentences with "And" or "But" when it feels natural
- Use contractions (you're, we'll, it's) - they sound more human

## Word Choice

- Prefer simple words over complex ones (use → utilize, help → facilitate, show → demonstrate)
- Avoid jargon unless the context requires it
- Write for an 8th-grade reading level in user-facing content
- Skip corporate speak ("leverage", "synergy", "optimize")

## Tone

- Direct but friendly
- Confident without being preachy
- Respectful of all political perspectives - no condescension
- Action-oriented - tell people what they can do

## Examples

**Avoid:**
> This platform — designed with bipartisan cooperation in mind — enables citizens to engage with immigration policy through their unique ideological lens.

**Prefer:**
> This platform helps you explore immigration policy through your own perspective. It's built for Americans across the political spectrum.

**Avoid:**
> Utilize the interactive questionnaire to determine your alignment score; subsequently, you'll receive personalized recommendations.

**Prefer:**
> Take the quiz to see where you stand. Then we'll show you actions that match your values.
